These are scripts from a Tabletop Simulator Mod I worked on that link a Notion database as a read/write source for tracking character stats and updates during a campaign
game to record data in between sessions.  You will need to customize your own input fields.

There is also a script to add buttons to a deck of cards to flip over a specific number of cards to improve usability during the game.
